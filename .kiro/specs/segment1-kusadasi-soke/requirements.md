# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Segment 1 of "Bilal & Köpüş: Mission Asena" - the horizontal side-scrolling journey from Kuşadası to Söke. This segment serves as the foundation for testing and validating core game mechanics including character movement, companion AI, collision detection, parallax scrolling, and interactive elements. The segment features a coastal-to-inland transition with three distinct environmental zones and implements the essential gameplay systems that will be extended to subsequent segments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control Bilal's movement through a horizontal scrolling world, so that I can navigate from Kuşadası to Söke with responsive character controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses the D key THEN Bilal SHALL move right with running animation
2. WHEN the player presses the A key THEN Bilal SHALL move left with running animation
3. WHEN the player presses the W key THEN Bilal SHALL jump with jump animation
4. WHEN the player presses the E key near a collectible THEN the interaction SHALL be triggered
5. WHEN no movement keys are pressed THEN Bilal SHALL display idle animation
6. WHEN on mobile devices THEN on-screen buttons SHALL provide the same control functionality
5. WHEN Bilal moves THEN the camera SHALL follow horizontally with smooth scrolling
6. WHEN Bilal reaches the right edge of the current view THEN the map SHALL scroll to reveal new areas

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want Köpüş (the companion dog) to follow me automatically, so that I have a loyal companion throughout the journey without manual control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bilal moves right THEN Köpüş SHALL follow behind at a consistent distance
2. WHEN Bilal stops moving THEN Köpüş SHALL catch up and stop near Bilal
3. WHEN Bilal jumps THEN Köpüş SHALL attempt to follow with appropriate AI behavior
4. WHEN Köpüş encounters chickens THEN Köpüş SHALL display barking animation and brief chase behavior
5. IF Köpüş falls behind THEN Köpüş SHALL increase movement speed to catch up

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experience a visually rich environment with depth, so that the journey feels immersive with realistic parallax scrolling effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera scrolls horizontally THEN background layers SHALL move at different speeds to create depth
2. WHEN at Kuşadası start THEN the background SHALL display coastal scenery with sea, beaches, and palm trees
3. WHEN transitioning through mid-segment THEN the background SHALL gradually change to olive groves and village roads
4. WHEN approaching Söke THEN the background SHALL display cotton fields and farmland
5. WHEN scrolling THEN distant mountains SHALL move slowest, middle layer trees SHALL move at medium speed, and foreground objects SHALL move fastest

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to collect items and interact with the environment, so that I can discover humorous content and engage with the game world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses E key near a collectible THEN the item SHALL be collected and disappear
2. WHEN a beer can is collected THEN a dialogue bubble SHALL appear with "Ah Tuborg, her favorite."
3. WHEN a cigarette pack is collected THEN a dialogue bubble SHALL appear with appropriate text
4. WHEN a pizza slice is collected THEN a dialogue bubble SHALL appear with appropriate text
5. WHEN any dialogue bubble appears THEN it SHALL automatically disappear after 3 seconds
6. WHEN collectibles are placed THEN they SHALL be distributed throughout the segment at logical locations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to encounter obstacles and NPCs that create gameplay variety, so that the journey feels dynamic and entertaining.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bilal encounters a sheep herd THEN movement SHALL be slowed or blocked temporarily
2. WHEN Bilal touches escaping chickens THEN a minor interruption animation SHALL play
3. WHEN passing tea house NPCs THEN brief humorous dialogue bubbles SHALL appear automatically
4. WHEN encountering any obstacle THEN appropriate collision detection SHALL prevent passing through
5. WHEN obstacles are animated THEN they SHALL move according to their defined behavior patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want checkpoint systems to save progress, so that I don't lose advancement if I need to restart.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reaching the mid-segment checkpoint THEN progress SHALL be automatically saved
2. WHEN reaching the pre-Söke checkpoint THEN progress SHALL be automatically saved
3. WHEN restarting from a checkpoint THEN Bilal and Köpüş SHALL spawn at the checkpoint location
4. WHEN a checkpoint is reached THEN a visual indicator SHALL briefly appear to confirm the save
5. IF the player restarts THEN they SHALL resume from the most recent checkpoint

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth physics and collision systems, so that character movement feels natural and interactions work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bilal lands on platforms THEN collision detection SHALL prevent falling through
2. WHEN Bilal jumps THEN gravity SHALL apply realistic falling physics
3. WHEN Köpüş moves THEN separate collision detection SHALL apply for the companion
4. WHEN characters interact with environment objects THEN appropriate physics responses SHALL occur
5. WHEN collision boundaries are defined THEN they SHALL accurately match visual sprite boundaries

### Requirement 8
